1. To set up database run Create.sql and Insert.sql from MillionaireGameWeb.SQL
(Note: if you don't have SQLEXPRESS then change connection string in web.config to match yours)
2. Run app from MillionaireGameWeb.UI
3. To test error logging you can run app on localhost and try to send email without internet connection. 
A new log should be added to table ExceptionLogs in database.
If you try it in debug mode exception will be highlighted first, then it will show error page, without debugging - just error page.
